# TerrainGenerator

Small terrain generator I made, probably not very good one at that

This is does actually function now, could do some stuff with making the terrain editable at runtime, but I dislike frontend

I got halfway through lighting and stopped cause I don't want to implement shadows, and I want this to run quickly on my laptop so im not adding ray tracing.

For the very few people who come across this and wanna actually compile it and whatnot, the libglad file is just the glad core from the glad.dav1d.de website, compiled for x86_64, actually nothing else in it, I deleted the glad.c after I compiled the static library.
