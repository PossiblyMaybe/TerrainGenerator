# TerrainGenerator

This is currently a WIP, im just putting everything up here so far because I managed to get noise working

Essentially right now this is just a compute shader implementation of 2D simplex noise.

Right now all it can do is output to a ppm

Next we make it visible in the viewport

Then make it editable in real time

That's about the goal.


I have no idea if this will run on non UNIX systems because i've done 0 stuff for compatability cause im new to c++ and opengl
